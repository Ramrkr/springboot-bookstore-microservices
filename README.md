# 📚 Book Store Microservices

A modular Spring Boot microservices application for managing a book store. Built with service discovery, API gateway routing, and RESTful communication between services.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **API Gateway**: Routes client requests to appropriate services
- **Book Service**: Manages book inventory and details
- **Order Service**: Handles order placement and tracking
- **Eureka Server**: Service registry for dynamic discovery

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **H2 / MySQL (configurable)**
- **Feign Client (for inter-service communication)**
- **Maven**

    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [api-gateway, book-service, order-service, eureka-server]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
