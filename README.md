Awesome, Ramanathan! Let’s supercharge your repo with both a `/docs` folder and a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow. Here's what I’ll scaffold for you:

---

## 📁 `/docs` Folder Structure

Each service gets its own Markdown file with clean documentation. Here's the layout:

```
/docs
├── index.md
├── api-gateway.md
├── book-service.md
├── order-service.md
└── eureka-server.md
```

### ✅ `index.md`
```markdown
# 📚 Book Store Microservices Documentation

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

Here’s a basic workflow to build and test your services on every push:

### ✅ `.github/workflows/microservices-ci.yml`
```yaml
name: Microservices CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [api-gateway, book-service, order-service, eureka-server]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'

      - name: Build ${{ matrix.service }}
        run: |
          cd ${{ matrix.service }}
          mvn clean install
```
